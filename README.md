# mom.vim
An updated vim syntax highlighting for the mom macros

The original syntax file (Last edited 6th March 2005) provided with the macros didn't work so well with Neovim so I created 
own following more modern conventions. The highlighting seems to work now.

Here's a link to the repo with the (unedited) macros. Note this one contains the old syntax file.
